REQUIREMENTS:

To run the project, you must install the following:

1) OpenCV 2.4.9
2) JavaCV 0.6
3) Eclipse (or similar)


Once you have installed the required softwares, the program requires
that you have yellow and red objects ready at hand. We recommend using
yellow or red electric tape since they are easy to find and can take the
shape of your fingers without much effort.

Yellow colored objects scroll the mouse present on your computer.
Red colored objects behave as a mouse click.
Please refer to the pictures labelled "How to use" along with the demo
video.


Thanks!
